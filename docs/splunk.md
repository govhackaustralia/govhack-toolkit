# Splunk

*Splunk are a sponsor of GovHack 2015*

Splunk provides an easy to use platform for searching, analysing, and visualising data; including mapping visualisations, structured and unstructured data. Splunk is available as a hosted service Splunk Cloud, or as a software package you install on a platform that you manage with Splunk Enterprise.

For examples of how Splunk has been used at GovHack-like events in the past, visit [splunk4good](http://splunk4good.com) and [Splunk blog posts from David Greenwood](http://blogs.splunk.com/author/dgreenwood/).
