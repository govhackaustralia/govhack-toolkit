# HP - Helion Development Platform

*HP are a sponsor of GovHack 2015*

The HP Helion Development Platform is a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that helps developers build great cloud-native applications across private and public clouds.

Based on Cloud Foundry the HP Helion Development Platform is fully integrated with HP Helion OpenStack, is open and interoperable, and allows developers to focus on development rather than infrastructure, using PaaS tools to build and deploy the right apps for any environment. The Helion Development Platform has support for languages such as Java, Python, Ruby, PHP, and Node.js, and open source technologies such as MySQL, RabbitMQ, and MemCache.

HP has made a complimentary hosting environment available specifically for teams participating in GovHack 2015. Instructions to use the platform can be found [here](assets/GovHack-HowtousetheHDP.pdf), and a quick video tutorial is available on YouTube.
