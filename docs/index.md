<h1>The GovHack Developer Toolkit</h1>

This page provides all the information you'll need to prepare your [GovHack](http://www.govhack.org/) entries, and a wealth of links to tools, techniques, and libraries to help you build an awesome project. You can use these resources to build any sort of project - mobile apps, web apps, APIs, data visualisations/infographics, and more. You're not limited to using the resources and tools in this page, but your actual entries must meet the [competition eligibility rules](http://www.govhack.org/competition-rules-code-of-conduct/).

If you're new to GovHack (or are just a little unclear on the process involved) we strongly encourage you to read the [Anatomy of GovHack project](/event-info/anatomy/) section at the top of this page to find out all about the process of registering, preparing, and submitting your entry.

Beyond that, you'll find a range of useful resources from [how best to put your entry online](/event-info/project-hosting/), to [suggestions of tools to use to maximise your hacking productivity](/event-info/productive-hacking/), resources for working with [geographic](/technical/geographic-data/) and [tabular](/technical/tabular-data/) data, to extracting good data from [messy unstructured sources](/technical/unstructed-data/), and much more.
