# The Digital Service Standard

The Federal government's new [Digital Transformation Office](https://www.dto.gov.au/) is building a new digital service standard for government agencies that establishes best practice standards for government digital services to ensure agencies provide high quality services that users actually want to use.

How is that relevant to GovHack? You may not building a multi-million dollar digital system for government, but at the core of it your GovHack project should adhere to all of the same principles and guidelines as a huge government project.

## Principles of digital service design

Keep your hack focussed, and your team on task, by keeping to the seven simple principles for designing better services.

1. Users first
2. Have a clear purpose
3. Keep it simple
4. Work together
5. Innovate and experiment
6. Design end to end
7. Use data to make decisions

Sounds simple? Check out the DTO's [simple guide to digital design principles](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/principles-digital-service-design) and then think about how you will apply them to the [service design process](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/principles-digital-service-design/service-design-process).

## Applying the standard

High-level principles for digital service delivery are great - but what about applying them in practice? Check out DTO's *comprehensive* guide to [applying the standard](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard). The guide covers all manner of topics, including:

* [User-centred design](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard/user-centred-design)
* [Writing digital content](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard/writing-digital-content)
* [Using APIs](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard/using-apis)
* [Building secure services](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard/building-secure-services)
* [Designing inclusive services](https://www.dto.gov.au/standard/how-apply-standard/designing-inclusive-services)
